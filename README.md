# Sonobuoy

**Maintainers:** [Heptio][0]

[![Build Status][1]][2]


## Overview

Heptio Sonobuoy is a diagnostic tool that makes it easier to understand the state of a Kubernetes cluster by running a set of [Kubernetes][3] conformance tests in an accessible and non-destructive manner. It is a customizable, extendable, and cluster-agnostic way to generate clear, informative reports about your cluster--regardless of your deployment details.

Its selective data dumps of Kubernetes resource objects and cluster nodes allow for the following use cases:

* Integrated end-to-end (e2e) [conformance-testing 1.7+][13]
* Workload debugging
* Custom data collection via extensible plugins

## Quickstart

> Heptio provides prebuilt Sonobuoy container images in its Google Container Registry (*gcr.io/heptio-images*). For the sake of faster setup on your cluster, **this quickstart pulls from this registry to skip the container build process**. You can use this same process to deploy Sonobuoy to production.
>
> See [Build From Scratch][4] for instructions on building Sonobuoy yourself.

This guide executes a Sonobuoy run on your cluster, and records the following results:
* Basic info about your cluster's hosts, Kubernetes resources, and versions.
* *(Via plugin)* [`systemd`][14] logs from each host
* *(Via plugin)* The results of a single e2e conformance test ("Pods should be submitted and removed"). See the [conformance guide][13] for configuration details.

### 0. Prerequisites

* *You should have access to an up-and-running Kubernetes cluster.* If you do not have a cluster, follow the [AWS Quickstart Kubernetes Tutorial][5] to set one up with a single command.

* *You should have `kubectl` installed.* If not, follow the instructions for [installing via Homebrew (MacOS)][6] or [building the binary (Linux)][7].

### 1. Download
Clone or fork the Sonobuoy repo:
```
git clone git@github.com:heptio/sonobuoy.git
```

### 2. Run

Determine if your `kube-apiserver` supports RBAC with the following command:
```
export RBAC_ENABLED=$(kubectl api-versions | grep "rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1" -c)
```
The environment variable you set here indicates whether RBAC-related resources should be included in the autogenerated, standalone YAML file. In an cluster running with `--authorization-mode=RBAC`, these resources are required to allow Sonobuoy to run properly.

Generate the YAML examples:
```
make generate-examples
```

This should create a collection of YAML files in your `examples/quickstart` directory. Note that the `components` sub-directory exists to help you understand Sonobuoy's different working parts, but is not necessary to run Sonobuoy itself.

To actually deploy a Sonobuoy pod to your cluster, run the following command in the Sonobuoy root directory:
```
kubectl apply -f examples/quickstart/aggregate.yaml
```

You can view actively running pods with the following command:
```
kubectl get pods -l component=sonobuoy --namespace=heptio-sonobuoy
```

To verify that Sonobuoy has completed successfully, check the logs:
```
kubectl logs -f sonobuoy --namespace=heptio-sonobuoy
```
If you see the log line `no-exit was specified, sonobuoy is now blocking`, the Sonobuoy pod has completed its data collection.

> *Notes*:
>
> * **The Sonobuoy pod in this example continues to run after it finishes data collection**, due to the `--no-exit` flag in its YAML manifest. This allows you to easily grab the results tarball.
>
> * **Sonobuoy collects one data report per run**---each time you want a new report you need to delete the existing Sonobuoy YAML files and reapply them (see the [tear down step][15]).
>
> * **In practice, you should make sure that the Sonobuoy pod writes its results to a Persistent Volume.** The quickstart example writes its output to an `emptyDir` volume for simplicity.
>
> *Troubleshooting errors from `kubectl logs`*:
>  * If you are able to debug and resolve the issue on your own, *make sure to delete and reapply Sonobuoy's YAML manifests*. Otherwise, [file an issue][10].
>

To view the output, copy the output directory from the main Sonobuoy pod to somewhere local:
```
kubectl cp heptio-sonobuoy/sonobuoy:/tmp/sonobuoy ./results --namespace=heptio-sonobuoy
```

This should copy a single `.tar.gz` snapshot from the Sonobuoy pod into your local `./results` directory. You can extract its contents into `/.results` with:
```
tar xzf ./results/*.tar.gz
```

For information on the contents of the snapshot, see the [snapshot documentation](docs/snapshot.md).

*NOTE: At this time, the layout of the contents of the tarball is subject to change.*

### 3. Tear down

To clean up Kubernetes objects created by Sonobuoy, run the following command:
```
kubectl delete -f examples/quickstart/aggregate.yaml
```

## Further documentation

 To learn how to configure your Sonobuoy runs and integrate plugins, see the [`/docs` directory][9].

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any problems that the documentation does not address, [file an issue][10].
